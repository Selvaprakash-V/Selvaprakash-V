## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a data-focused engineer who enjoys turning messy, real-world data into meaningful insights and intelligent systems.  
My work sits at the intersection of **data analysis, machine learning, and software engineering** — with an emphasis on **practical impact**, not toy projects.

I believe in:
- Clean data > fancy models
- Explainable insights > black-box predictions
- Building things that actually solve problems
